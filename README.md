PayPal.pay({
  price: '40.70',

}).then(confirm => console.log(confirm))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### FuturePayment

```javascript
import PayPal from 'react-native-paypal-gateway';

// Required for Future Payments
const options = {
  merchantName : "Merchant name",
  merchantPrivacyPolicyUri: "https://example.com/privacy",
  merchantUserAgreementUri: "https://example.com/useragreement",
}
// 3 env available: NO_NETWORK, SANDBOX, PRODUCTION
PayPal.initializeWithOptions(PayPal.NO_NETWORK, "<your-client-id>", options);

PayPal.obtainConsent().then(authorization => console.log(authorization))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

// To decrease payment declines, you must specify a metadata ID header (PayPal-Client-Metadata-Id)
// in the payment call. See docs:

const metadataID = await PayPal.getClientMetadataId();

### Acknowledgement

This Project is the copied version of [Taessina](taessina/react-native-paypal-wrapper )
(which had a severe issue of crashing the app on card payment in iOS, since the original repo was archived. We had to made modification to resolve this issue).

This project is inspired by [MattFoley](https://github.com/MattFoley/react-native-paypal) (which does not support both Android and iOS simultaneously, and [shovelapps](https://github.com/shovelapps/react-native-paypal) a fork of the former repo (which we had some problems trying to integrate due to React Native version).
